1.	Prerequisites
	
	Hardware: 	-Volksbot (VB)
				-USB to miniUSB cable to connect Volksbot to PC
				-Joystick / wireless controller

	Software:	-ROS kinetic
				-ROS packages:	volksbot_driver, joy, teleop_twist_joy
				-libepos2-dev (see http://wiki.ros.org/volksbot_driver for installation instruction)
				-"joy_volksbot.launch"  launchfile
				-"*.config.yaml" configfile for your joystick

2. 	Configfile and Launchfile Setup

	Open the "joy_volksbot.launch" file and change the default value of "joy_config" to the name of your given joystick. That would be "logitech" if you would be using a logitech joystick and your config file is called "logitech.config.yaml". 

	Open a terminal and run:

	roslaunch volskbot_driver joy_volksbot.launch
	
	
	Another way would be to later run the lauchfile with "joy_config" as an argument.

3.	Connection

	Connection between laptop and VB is via USB. The USB port of VB is on the side of one of the Maxxon Motor Drivers. The Motor Drivers are the two black boxes inside VB, one of thoses works as a master, thats the one with the USBport. Also connect your joystick to the laptop of course;)

4.  Starting-up
	
	Power up VB. See VB user manual if you dont know how do do that, also check if the emergency switch isnt pressed if youre having problems.

	Run the launchfile. Error "No FTDI devices connected" means no connection between VB and PC.

5.	Driving 

	All configs right now mapped the joystick as followed:

		-One of the shoulder button enables movement
		-Another shoulder button enables turbo movement, thats basically two times the speed but concerns only moving forward and backwards, not twisting
		-Right stick vertical: Moving forwards and backwards
		-Right stick horizontal: Twisting Clockwise and Counterclockwise

6. Using a new Joystick and creating your own configfile

	-Connect your joystick
	-$ rosrun joy joy_node
	-$ rostopic echo /joy
	-note the numbers of the buttons and sticks, first button/stick is index 0
	-change or create configfile with these numbers
	-you can check your mappings with running "joy_node" and "teleop_node" (pkg=teleop_twist_joy) and then "rostopic echo /cmd_vel", make sure though, that you have loaded the configfile to the parameter server
